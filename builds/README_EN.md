# unity-reference-viewer

[**Japanese**](README.md)

It's a tool for searching asset references on Unity and displaying them on the window.  
Example, Examine material using texture.  

Unity standard "ref:" is effective when the scale of the project is large and Unity may crash.  
It's characterized by whether the GUID of the target asset is included in the file contents is searched by the function of OS, not on Unity.  
  
It process relatively fast depending on the environment. So doesn't cache results.

## Exclude settings

You can specify the file you want to exclude from the search results in "ExcludeSettings.asset".  
Specifying a binary file etc can improve the accuracy of searching and speed up.

## In MacOS, Spotlight or Grep

Spotlight is a standard search function(mdfind) used on Mac.
It works very fast, but the search fails unless the file index is correctly created.
If you need to search exactly please use the Grep version.

## Use GitGrep

The newly added GitGrep version can find projects managed by Git accurately and quickly.
Can use by Mac and Windows.
